We encourage you to follow the steps below:

1. General tool setup
2. Track-specific setup
    - MOSbius
    - Digital Building Blocks
    - Analog Automation

For the 2025 Chipathon, we will use the open-source GlobalFoundries 180nm (gf180) process design kit (PDK). You can refer to the links below for more information:

# 1. General Tool Setup

The following guidelines help you set up the tools using the [IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools) Docker image developed by Harald Pretl's team.

**NOTE**: For this Chipathon, it is not required to use the repository for the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS directly, since startup-scripts are provided in [resources/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](/resources/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS).

**NOTE**: For this Chipathon, a special image of the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS is released, with the tag "chipathon". If you use the start-scripts provided here, this tag is used automatically.

Please start with the Quick Start Guide and setup Docker Desktop and the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS. Then, choose one of the following tutorial links to set up the tools, which best fits your environment. Experienced users may configure the tools using their own preferred approach.

The **MOSbius** and **Analog Automation** tracks require slight variations of the general tool setup. Once you are familiar with the general procedure, adapting it for each track should be straightforward.

## Quick Start Guide

A general quick start guidel on how to get Docker Desktop with the tools up and running on Windows, MacOS or Linux can be found [here](/docs/install_instructions).

## Other Installation Tutorials

This instructions provide more details on setups for the specific tracks and/or are more detailed.
